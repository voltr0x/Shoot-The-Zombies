# Shoot-The-Zombies
A top down isometric view survival shooter where players have to shoot waves of zombies. The assets are developed on Blender which I have created for the first time, whereas the game is developed on Unity with implemented game play mechanics of levels (increasing difficulty with each wave of enemies) and power-ups such as ammo and health. It is an on-going project and there are many design plans planned. To view the code go to Assets folder and then Scripts folder.
